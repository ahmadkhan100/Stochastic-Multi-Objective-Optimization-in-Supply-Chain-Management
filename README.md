# Stochastic-Multi-Objective-Optimization-in-Supply-Chain-Management

## Overview
This project implements a genetic algorithm to solve a multi-objective optimization problem in supply chain management. The objectives are to minimize cost and time while maximizing service levels across a network of suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and customers.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains data files used in the project.
- `src/`: Contains the core code files.
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests for the project.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SupplyChainOptimization.git
    cd SupplyChainOptimization
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the main script**:
    ```sh
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Usage
